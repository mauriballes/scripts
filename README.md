# Scripts for Ubuntu

```
Note: All these scripts were tested in Ubuntu 16.04.1 LTS, but they should work
with any software distributions based on Debian. Feel free to notify if you
find any issue.
```

These are a set of shell scripts that help to make easier some common tasks and
commands we always used when we are working with GNU/Linux.

I hope that these shell scripts can help you and send me an email for new ideas
for next scripts.

## How to Use

First, you have to ensure that scripts have execution permission. To do that you
can execute the next command:

`$ sudo chmod +x script_name.sh`

Once you have given execution permission, for execute the script you can do this:

`$ ./script_name.sh`

Some scripts need to be executed as root. If it necessary execute as root, you
need to put **sudo** before execute the script.

`$ sudo ./script_name.sh`

## TO DO

- Organize scripts in folders
- Include a brief description about each script
- Something else
